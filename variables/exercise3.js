//Exercise 3: Arithmetic Operations

// Declare two variables num1 and num2 and assign them any 2 numbers
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 5;

// Declare variables to store the sum, difference, product, and quotient of num1 and num2
let sum = num1 + num2;
let difference = num1 - num2;
let product = num1 * num2;
let quotient = num1 / num2;

// Print results of arithmetic operations
console.log("Sum: " + sum);
console.log("Difference: " + difference);
console.log("Product: " + product);
console.log("Quotient: " + quotient);
